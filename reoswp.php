						<li> All payments are processed through an independent third party pay system (Forte Payment Systems).  Accordingly, Real Estate One does not retain any confidential credit card information. </li>
						<li> Payments will be applied to REO Sales Associate's A/R when received from third party pay system (generally the same day). <strong> Payments received by 3:00 p.m. Monday - Friday will be applied the same day. Payments received after 3:00 p.m. Monday - Friday or on weekends or holidays will be applied the following business day. </strong> </li>
						<li> Late fees and interest will be charged to past due accounts in accordance with Company policy.  While auto pay may reduce the risk of becoming past due, Sales Associates are responsible for reviewing monthly statements and ensuring that the account is paid current.
